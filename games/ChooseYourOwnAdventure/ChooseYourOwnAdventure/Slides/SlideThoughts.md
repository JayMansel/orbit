Welcome the audience

# Character selection

While this slightly contradicts the premise of a choose your own adventure book I needed to somehow slip in who I am. Given that the underlying theme of this talk is around building games I thought that a character selection screen made sense.

So who am I?

My name is Shaun Lawrence
I am a software engineer/consultant and have been working with .NET based technologies since my career began roughly 17 years ago.
I am honoured to have been awarded with the Microsoft MVP award for the past 2 years.
I was also 'lucky' enough to be given the opportunity to write a book. My publishing keeps telling me off for not talking about it enough so it is titled 'Introducing .NET MAUI' and is available at all good online book retailers.
In fact I have a copy with me today which I plan to give away at random. More on this shortly...

I guess part of the main reason I am here talking to you all today is because I have learned to fully embrace what I have labelled as weakenesses here.
I do get distracted easily and much like Magpie I like to chase after the next shiny thing.
I am also great at following that shiny thing down a deep deep rabbit hole, get lost or stuck down there and then end up eating some cake to cheer me up.
In fact I now wonder whether I have somehow been rewarding this behaviour...

# Prologue

So that is enough about my, let's take a brief look at what we will be covering today and how...

I am very passionate about gaming, exposing our creative sides and just generally having a bit of fun, because of this I could talk for hours and at one or two meetups I have.
We only have 60 minutes today and ironically given my childhood love of 'choose your own adventure' books I am now terrible at decision making and try my best to avoid it where I can.
Therefore the structure of the content today will be up to you the collective audience or the real characters of this story.
I have tried to devise some key decision points around certain topics and through a SignalR based voting system plus the fact that the slides are built entirely inside a .NET MAUI application/game
you can and assuming no bugs raise their ugly heads, will drive the specific parts of those topics. In fact one decision point allows us to even look into the code that drives todays content.

I mentioned before that I would be giving a copy of my book away today. If all goes well and I will be honest this part scares me a little as I saw some inconsistencies in leading up to this part
after voting on the last decision point one lucky voter will be shown a congratulations message. The message does say to come down and collect your prize, it might be best to take a screenshot and then come down
at the end of the talk.

Test run of the voting system?

Slides around game controller support?

Decision around accessibility?
